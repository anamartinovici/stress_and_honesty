This repository includes data and code for the analysis reported in "The effect of acute stress on dishonesty: the moderating role of moral default" (Sebastian P.H. Speer, Ana Martinovici, Ale Smidts, Maarten A.S. Boksem).

If you want to reproduce the results, you need to knit `analysis.Rmd`. This takes approximately 5 minutes on a Windows device with 16GB of RAM and Intel Core i7 CPU. 

Note that in order to knit `analysis.Rmd` you need to have `R`, `RStudio`, `tidyverse` and `rstan` installed on your device. `analysis.html` includes information about the specific version of `R` and `R packages` used to generate the results.
