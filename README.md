This repository includes data and code for the analysis reported in "The effect of acute stress on dishonesty: the moderating role of moral default" (Sebastian P.H. Speer, Ana Martinovici, Ale Smidts, Maarten A.S. Boksem).

If you want to see the results, then you can clone (or download) the repository and open `analysis.html` in a browser.

If you want to reproduce the results, you need to knit `analysis.Rmd`. `analysis.html` includes information about how long this takes on a Windows device with 64GB of RAM and Intel Xeon CPU E5-1620 v3 3.5GHz. Note that the file can also be knit on a device with less RAM (e.g., 16 GB).

Note that in order to knit `analysis.Rmd` you need to have `R`, `RStudio`, `tidyverse` and `rstan` installed on your device. `analysis.html` includes information about the specific version of `R` and `R packages` used to generate the results.
